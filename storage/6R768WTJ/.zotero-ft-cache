CONSPECTUS: In the present Account, we report the recent progress of our research group on experimental and theoretical studies of defects in 2D and 0D hexagonal boron nitride. The studies of the effect of defects in boron-based structures have been also extended to boron oxide glasses. Engineering the different types of defects in h-BN is paramount because many functional properties of the material depend on them. This is particularly true for h-BN nanomaterials because of the main role played by surfaces. An important finding is that the formation of defects is directly dependent on the synthesis route; bottom-up or top-down syntheses generate different types of defects whose origins are generally connected to vacancies, dangling bonding, and substitutional oxygen impurities. We have focused our attention, in particular, on the correlation between defects and photoluminescence. The first part of this Account is dedicated to a general overview of defects that form in h-BN systems. In the second and third parts, we report on the rise of fluorescence in different types of h-BN nanostructures, in particular nanoflakes and BN dots. h-BN nanoflakes become fluorescent due to the presence of substitutional oxygen in the structure. The emission depends on the thermal processing of the material. A postsynthesis thermal treatment, because it induces the condensation of oxygen-related bonds that at the origin of fluorescence, changes the photoluminescence according to the degree of condensation of the structure. In the case of BN, the defects in dots and 0D nanostructures are discussed as a function of their preparation route. The analysis of defects in h-BN dots shows that not only vacancies and impurities can contribute to emission but also structural defects such as Stone−Wales. Understanding the origin of such defects and correlating them with specific optical properties is of the utmost importance because comprehending such phenomena could also guide the fabrication of new boron oxide emissive materials. In the last example, we show that the formation of defects, such as dangling bondings and vacancies, is the basis of a surprising phosphorescence at room temperature in boron oxide materials. We have observed, in particular, that the rise of boric acid phosphorescence after heat treatment is related to the presence of defects. The afterglow results from a trapping and detrapping process, which delays recombination at the active optical centers. The formation of near UV and blue optical transitions in absorption is revealed by a time-dependent density functional analysis of defective BOH molecules and clusters. In thermally processed boric acid samples, these defects cause photoluminescence.
1. INTRODUCTION
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is characterized by a honeycomb layered structure similar to that of graphene. The interplanar interactions in bulk h-BN (point group = D6h; space group = P63/mmc), as in graphite, are determined by van der
Waals forces, while the B−N bonds maintain sp2 hybridization and a weak ionic character compared with the purely covalent
C−C bonding of graphite.1 However, unlike the graphite pattern, the interlayer disposition of the BN sheets exhibits a displaced arrangement of atoms with boron atoms positioned above nitrogen. This structural arrangement affects the local polarity of the B−N bonds as well as the interlayer N-donor/Bacceptor characteristics. The most common BN crystalline phases are h-BN, wurtzite w-BN, cubic c-BN, and rhombohedral r-BN, but the most stable, and therefore the most used in nanotechnologies, is the hexagonal one. The amorphous form of BN is noncrystalline
and lacks any long-range organization in analogy to amorphous carbon.
The h-BN form has a high thermal stability2 to up to 1000 °C and only when treated in the 1000−1200 °C range transforms into B2O3, even if the oxidation in h-BN nanosheets begins from
850 °C.3 h-BN is also classified as an indirect band gap semiconductor (Eg)4 with an energy gap close to 6 eV. This wide band gap
enlarges the field of application to ultraviolet lasing,5

electronics,6 and photonics.7 Several types of nanostructures, from 2D to 0D, such as monolayers, nanoflakes, nanoribbons, nanotubes, dots, and nanocages up to fullerene-like molecules can be derived from h-BN.8,9 2D materials can be deposited as monolayers, while nanoflakes and nanosheets are generally obtained via exfoliation of the bulk.10 Even if several protocols have been established, controlling the number of layers, dimensions, and defects remains a technological challenge. This is true not only for 2D structures but also for dots and 1D materials. The effective application of the fundamental properties of boron nitride in the nanoscale is made possible by fabricating high-quality h-BN nanomaterials with few or controlled defects, particularly for developing electrical and optoelectronic devices. Several advanced applications have envisaged for nanostructured h-BN as van der Waals heterostructures, heat dissipators in electronic devices, and single photon emitters in solid state quantum devices. The formation of defects in h-BN is not limited to boron/ nitrogen vacancies, but multiple defects can occur, such as carbon,11 oxygen, and hydrogen impurities, boron/nitrogen vacancies,12 and donor−acceptor pairs.13 The topological distribution of the defects is also significant, and edge defects, especially in 1D and 0D dimensions, become increasingly important. Defects can also be induced during h-BN processing because some specific functional properties, such as photoluminescence, depend on defects. Numerous theoretical and experimental studies have examined the relationship between defects and photoluminescence. Defects cause fluorescence, whereas a defectless h-BN crystal exhibits no emission and a sharp band-to-band absorption edge. For example, single-photon emissions14 originate from atomic point defects and the identification of this characteristic contributed to the development of ultrabright, photostable, and broad-energy-range quantum emitters.15,16 In this Account, we review our studies of defects in h-BN nanostructures, contextualizing them based on the current understanding of the relationships between structural defects and functional properties. In particular, the following aspects have been emphasized: defect formation, their control during material synthesis, and the correlation between defects and luminescence. These experimental results make it possible to achieve a better understanding of the complex physicochemical phenomena governing the properties of boron nitride on the nanoscale.
2. A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF DEFECTS IN H-BN NANOMATERIALS
Processing functional h-BN nanomaterials requires an in-depth understanding and mastery of defects, especially for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Control of defects is crucial to reduce their presence when necessary and to modulate the material properties. The synthesis technique directly influences the type and the amount of defects, which can be of different nature. Indeed, defects can be related to the presence of anomalies in the regular lattice structure, and multiple defects such as carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen impurities and boron and nitrogen vacancies may also occur. The defects are also not homogeneously distributed in the material, while the edges also play a primary role, because of dangling bonds. Depending on the specific use case, the existence of imperfections, defined here broadly as structural elements causing h-BN to deviate from its ideal purity, may not necessarily exert a substantial influence or may even be advantageous. This underscores the importance of comprehending the methods to isolate particular defects and regulate their occurrence during the material’s production process. Inducing controlled structural defects in h-BN proves challenging. In general, fluorescent emissions from h-BN do not depend on electronic confinement effects due to nanometric size but rather on the presence of point defects and dislocations. Numerous defects typically arise randomly during h-BN synthesis, triggered by mechanical stress. These perturbations may promote the emergence of structural vacancies or the incorporation of new atoms, influenced by the choice of solvent during the exfoliation process or molecular precursors utilized in the synthesis. Obtaining h-BN nanomaterials involves two main approaches. Top-down synthesis, exemplified by “scotch-tape” (STE) and ball-milling methods, downsizes bulk material into nanoscale powder using external energy to break van der Waals forces. Solvent support enhances exfoliation and prevents sheet agglomeration. High-pressure microfluidization efficiently cleaves BN micropowders into thin fragments, yet challenges persist in achieving significant quantities for large-scale manufacturing. Chemical-assisted exfoliation, especially with sonication, is highly efficient, although the use of solvents, such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) may dope the structure with carbon impurities. While water is effective in BN exfoliation, it may lead to reactions and edge functionalization with OH. These approaches always provide structural defects whose percentage depends on the synthesis parameters. In particular, making use of organic solvents can promote carbon dimers and trimers that are supposed to emit in

UV and visible range.16 In the same way, OH and O defects can be introduced in the h-BN structure by using aqueous and acid
solutions.29,50 The drawbacks of top-down approaches include the high difficulty of controlling the occurrence of unwanted defects and selectively introducing suitable impurities and vacancies. STE exfoliation presents a unique case, enabling the exfoliation of a few layers of a high-quality material. This process facilitates the introduction of specific luminescent structural defects through postprocessing, as illustrated in Table 1. In the bottom-up approach, material creation involves elemental or molecular components reacting and assembling. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) ensures high-purity, low-defect layered materials by reacting BN molecular precursors such as borazine on substrates such as Pt (111) or Ni (111). Although CVD offers high-quality single BN sheets on various substrates, achieving large-scale usage and control over multiple layers remains challenging. Tailoring the BN film phases is achievable by selecting the appropriate substrate. Techniques such as pulsed layer deposition (PLD) or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) may offer improvements in scalability. CVD and MBE techniques enable the control of adventitious impurities, establishing an initial structure onto which targeted defects can be incorporated through exposure to high-energy particles or laser light. Conversely, bottom-up approaches from solution, like those utilized in generating zero-dimensional h-BN, remain significantly reliant on molecular precursors and solvents that may introduce unwanted fluorescent impurities (Table 1).
2.1. Intrinsic Defects
Intrinsic h-BN defects have been the subject of numerous publications aimed at identifying fundamental aspects such as structural reorganization (deviation from flatness), electronic distribution, and optical absorption induced by intragap levels. Without considering foreign atoms, the B−N structure alone can give rise to various defects with unique properties. Most theoretical studies delve into the physical properties of potential color center candidates responsible for observed single-photon emissions in h-BN monolayers. We can encounter several theoretical approaches, such as group theory and density functional theory (DFT), which provide strong evidence that the electronic characteristics of these color centers match those observed experimentally. Group theory methods are used to compute the multielectron wave functions of the defects and conduct a detailed analysis of spin interactions. First-principle DFT methods can be employed to determine energy levels and zero-phonon-line (ZPL) emissions. The VNNB neutral defect, consisting of a nitrogen vacancy near a nitrogen atom in boron sites, represents a peculiar defect within the hexagonal lattice in the framework of optical recombinations in the visible range. The suitability of the neutral VNNB defect and negatively charged VB defect as qubit candidates is based on their charge state’s relative stability. In the energy range of 1.9 eV < εF < 2.6 eV, both the neutral VNNB and neutral VB defects exhibit equal stability. However, for εF > 2.6 eV, the negatively charged VB defect becomes more stable. The VNNB defect in h-BN is constrained to specific orientations at θ = 0°, 120°, and 240°. Excitation of the VNNB defect primarily occurs through the inplane dipole moment, while the out-of-plane dipole moment can lead to excitations at energies around 2.0 eV. The excited VNNB defect can return to the ground state through nonradiative and radiative shelving processes with the presence of a shelving state 4A1. The effective g-factor of the electronic spin remains consistent in both ground and excited states, leading to an
absence of Zeeman splitting in the photoluminescence spectrum
of VNNB.25 The latter has attracted great attention because of its potential application in quantum information. In particular, the importance of charged states of VNNB. Intentionally incorporating VNNB defects into h-BN and achieving charged states of +1 and −1 could hold promise for quantum computing applications
that tap into various defect states. In particular, VNNB+1 and VNNB
−1 are anticipated to be capable of forming a durable quantum memory within h-BN, similar to the achievement seen
with the defects in diamond.26,27 First-principle density functional theory calculations have also been used to address the ultraviolet emission characteristics of
pentagon−heptagon Stone−Wales defects28,29 and optically
active square−octagon Stone−Wales line defects in h-BN.28 These results imply a potential re-evaluation of fluorescent centers in h-BN, emphasizing the significance of the interplay between point defects and structural defects for comprehending the observed color centers in this material. Through DFT
calculations, Hamdi et al.28 observed that the pentagon− heptagon Stone−Wales defect in hexagonal boron nitride acts as an ultraviolet emitter, resembling a commonly observed 4.08 eV quantum emitter in polycrystalline h-BN. Similarly, the square− octagon Stone−Wales line defects in h-BN exhibit optical
activity in the ultraviolet range. Ren et al.29 investigated the synthesis process and the impact of the Brønsted acid treatment. Bulk h-BN powders were dispersed in orthophosphoric acid through sonication, followed by thermal treatment, leading to a highly defective crystal structure, evident in the emergence of UV emissions. Correspondingly, they focused on assessing the influence of Stone−Wales (SW) defects on both the structural and optical characteristics of an h-BN cluster system. The study utilized a simplified model comprising a hexagonal monolayer of h-BN with 61 rings and fully saturated edges, totaling 180 atoms. The introduction of defects involved inserting a pentagon− heptagon structure resulting from a B−N couple rotation, ensuring a constant total atom count in the cluster. Defect formation energies were computed in a neutral charge state. The defect-free cluster demonstrated robust optical absorption at 205 nm, in good agreement with the experimental data. The optimized structure displayed B−N bond lengths of 1.446 Å at the center and 1.419 Å at the edge. The incorporation of SW defects led to a redshift in optical absorption, with the most pronounced transition occurring at 283 nm when two or three SW defects were present. This redshift was attributed to deformations in the structure induced by the defects. The HOMO−LUMO transition in the defective BN(SW) system revealed a concentrated charge distribution around the SW defect. The formation energy of SW defects varied with the position in the cluster, with a preference for formation at the edge. In general, defects in h-BN nanostructures are studied in an indirect way by combining different spectroscopies or direct observation by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nearedge X-ray absorption fine structure is also a powerful tool to investigate the formation of vacancies and has allowed researchers to identify the breaking of B−N bonds and the
formation of N vacancies.30
2.2. Carbon and Oxygen Defects
Much more relevant are the defects resulting from the treatment process of pure h-BN. As mentioned above, the solvent used for exfoliation can introduce atoms into the structure by promoting lower-energy optical absorption or facilitating photocatalytic

processes. Among the most common impurities that can be introduced are carbon and oxygen due to the use of organic solvents and water. The introduction of a substitutional carbon atom significantly changes the electronic properties compared to those of an undamaged boron nitride sheet. This substitution also leads to a notable decrease in the material work function. Defects create new electronic states within the energy gap, which strongly impact the h-BN optical properties. Additionally, the calculations show that the introduction of substitutional impurities or vacancy defects induces spin polarization in the structure. The calculations reveal a significant decrease in the work function compared with an undamaged h-BN sheet. The most significant reduction is observed with CB and VB defects, implying enhanced electron emission. Also, defects result in a narrower energy gap, and this reduction can be controlled by varying the defect concentration. The calculated spin density of states (DOS) shows that spontaneous magnetization occurs when substitutional impurities or vacancy defects are introduced
into the structure.31 The defects VNCB and VBCN were also examined. VNCB is suggested as a potential candidate for longlived quantum memory, while VBCN possesses a triplet ground state, rendering it suitable for tasks like spin initialization and
quantum-qubit operations.26 Winter et al. studied carbon dimers in h-BN. The luminescence zero-phonon energy of the carbon dimer defect is determined to be 4.36 eV, accounting for contributions from zero-point vibrational energy and reorganization energy. The presence of interlayer screening leads to a reduction in the emission energy by approximately 0.3 eV. The substitutional carbon dimer is identified as the probable source
of the 4.1 eV luminescence line.32 Monomers, dimers, trimers, and CNO pairs are the most common carbon defects in h-BN. In contrast, larger carbon clusters and complexes involving
vacancies and antisites are present in lower concentrations.33 Clusters of BN free from defects exhibit optical transitions above 6 eV. The introduction of oxygen impurities induces a shift
toward longer wavelengths in band-to-band absorption. It leads to a reduction in the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Charged defects, such as oxygen impurities and ONVB (oxygen−nitrogen−vacancy−boron) complexes, exhibit distinct mechanisms upon excitation. Interestingly, certain point defects exhibit varying mechanisms upon excitation, contingent on their type and charge. For instance, the positively charged (q = +1) oxygen impurities function as electron-withdrawing sites during HOMO-toLUMO excitation, whereas the 2ON and ONVB complex act as
recombination centers.34
2.3. Heavy Metals
Foreign atom effects were also evaluated by investigating h-BN
doped with heavy atoms.35 Various wavelengths of interest for quantum technology applications were selected, including representations of solid-state quantum emitters and qubits in diamond and silicon carbide, quantum memories in rare-earthion-doped crystals, and alkali vapor-based memories. Additionally, wavelengths important for long-distance quantum communication in the telecom windows were considered. The
study found suitable h-BN quantum emitters36 for most of these applications, demonstrating promise for efficient coupling with other quantum systems. In some cases, charged defects were identified as potential candidates. However, defects such as SnBVB, ErBVB+, and ErB+, while technically not meeting the criteria for deep defects, could function as single photon emitters. It was noted that the AlN defect was the only one found at 637 nm, implying that it may emit the two-photon Fock state, potentially useful in quantum interference experiments. Similarly, the impact of isolated transition metal atoms (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Ni) embedded in h-BN as single-atom catalysts for CO oxidation was also considered. The findings suggest that Ni atoms show the most promising performance as

they have low barriers for both Langmuir−Hinshelwood (LH) and termolecular Eley−Rideal (TER) processes. This makes them suitable for operation at temperatures between 300 and
500 K.37
3. DEFECT-ASSISTED PHOTOLUMINESCENCE IN H-BN LAYERS
As we previously pointed out, one of the most common topdown routes to obtain h-BN nanolayers is ultrasonic-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE). Ultrasonication, however, induces cavitation, i.e., the explosion and implosion of microbubbles, which promotes exfoliation through harsh and punctual changes in the pressure, temperature, and shear forces. A side effect of cavitation is inducing the formation of different types of defects, structural atomic vacancies, edge defects, and
the B−OH species.38 The solvent employed for the exfoliation is critical. Solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide and N-methyl-2pyrrolidone give almost defect-free h-BN sheets that are, in fact, not fluorescent, such as bulk h-BN. Water, instead, induces hydroxylation of nanostructured h-BN materials that, besides changing the optical properties, opens the possibility of further
functionalization of the surface.39 As-prepared h-BN sheets via PLE in water exhibit a weak
photoluminescence in the blue (Figure 1).34 The presence of defects characterizes the material due to the reaction with oxygen, as indicated by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, particularly B−OH and N−B−O bonds. A direct assessment of the relationship between defects and luminescence is difficult to assess. In general, even if many theoretical calculations have been performed to understand the nature of defects and their effects on the optical properties, an experimental correlation is much more challenging to achieve. The data show the presence of two main defects; a possible strategy to understand their role is to try to reduce one of them and measure the eventual change in the optical response. This study can be done by thermal treatment in air that should reduce the content of B−OH groups by condensation. The result is an increase in the fluorescence up to 300 °C; higher temperatures, instead, produce a fluorescence quenching (Figure 1). The N−B−O defects contribute to the BN visible emission. These defects are unstable at higher temperatures and undergo a further oxidizing process that quenches the luminescence. On the contrary, defect-free h-BN nanosheets prepared using DMSO and NMP as solvents do not exhibit oxygen defects and do not emit even after an oxidation treatment in air, demonstrating substantial thermal stability. Therefore, N−B− O oxygen defects are the key to controlling the photoluminescence (Figure 2). The rise of a specific infrared
absorption band (460 cm−1) with the increase of the thermal treatment temperature attributed to O−B−O bonds indicates
the transformation of N−B−O into the nonemissive boroxyl ring. Theoretical calculations validated the experimental results. Computational methods have been used to derive the UV−vis absorption spectra of h-BN cluster models, introducing different defects in the structure, nitrogen and boron vacancies, and oxygen impurities (Table 2). The most probable candidates for interpreting the optical properties of defective h-BN nanosheets are charged oxygen defects because they create intragap transitions in absorption that accurately mimic the observed spectra. The formation of defects in exfoliated h-BN also affects other properties besides the photoluminescence. Several research groups have used 2D h-BN to enhance the photocatalytic
response of photoactive materials such as titania.40 Hexagonal boron nitride, however, is characterized by a large band gap and is not a suitable choice for such applications. The h-BN nanosheets are very soluble in water, and several solvents can be employed to process thin films via liquid phase deposition. This property allows integrating h-BN nanosheets into titania
mesoporous films41 using a template-assisted sol−gel synthesis
and evaporation-induced self-assembly42 (Figure 3). Interestingly, the 2D material can be incorporated into the films without disrupting the pore organization, while the layers remain optically transparent. The role of h-BN defects has been assessed by comparing the optical properties and the photo
catalytic response of the heterostructures.43 It has been discovered that the defects in h-BN improve the film photocatalytic activity because of the higher ultraviolet radiation A (UVA) absorption. Furthermore, the h-BN sheets support the crystallization of anatase by heterogeneous nucleation and are optically transparent but lack any photocatalytic property.
4. DEFECTS IN 0D H-BN NANOMATERIALS
BN dots exhibit a remarkable fluorescence that is usually attributed to different mechanisms correlated with radiative recombinations activated by the presence of defects, such as boron or nitrogen vacancies, carbene structures, and oxygen impurities. The synthesis of 0D h-BN nanomaterials offers several choices regarding the available strategies. They can be top-down, starting with bulk h-BN, or bottom-up, with boron and nitrogen
chemical precursors. Top-down routes, such as mechanical,44
hydrothermal,45 microwave,46 sonication,47 and exfoliation, are
based on fragmenting h-BN sheets to obtain nano dots.48 A typical bottom-up chemical method is the reaction of boric acid and ammonia under hydrothermal conditions. The bottom-up routes, however, do not allow, in general, to obtain pure BN dots, and the final material can contain several foreign atoms such as oxygen (boron oxynitride) or carbon or a combination of both (carbon boron oxynitride) and hydrogen. Carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen impurities enter the BN structure throughout the preparation process, and their presence can be somewhat controlled. Defects in BN dots are also fundamental to modulating the
optical properties.49 In the case of hydrothermal synthesis from H3BO3 and NH3, used as precursors of boron and nitrogen, respectively, the final material is more correctly identified as a
boron oxynitride dot (BOND).50 Interestingly, such dots can show a two-color emission (Figure 4). The emission of the two components decreases in intensity with the increase in thermal treatment temperature. The condensation of the structure decreases the number of defects and in turn quenches the

fluorescence. The emission remains stable at 25 °C, and the BONDs can be incorporated into a solid-state matrix to fabricate thin emitting films via sol−gel processing. The synthesis of BN dots from a top-down route opens a different scenario. Controlling the amount of impurities proves difficult in bottom-up syntheses, and in general, the functions of the final product are regulated by the amount and types of impurities, as well as the defects commonly found in boron nitride structures. In top-down syntheses of BN dots, the process is similar to that used to obtain 2D materials. Bulk h-BN powders are exfoliated and fragmented by cavitation via sonication, but ball-milling, solvothermal, or microwave treatments are also suitable routes. The solvents employed represent a key point of the process. Water, ethylene glycol, dimethylformamide (DMF), and 1methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) are among the most common, but organic solvents have the drawback that carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen impurities can enter into the B−N structure of the dots. The presence of carbon atoms is a source of uncertainty in modulating and understanding the optical and structural
properties of the h-BN systems. To avoid an uncontrolled presence of carbon, the BN bulk material must be exfoliated with a carbon-free liquid phase but also in this case formation of defects should be expected. We created luminescent BN dots via a two-step protocol by heating bulk h-BN in H3PO4 and then treating the resultant product in an ultrasonic bath for several hours. The synthesized BN dots share structural features with bulk h-BN but exhibit novel optical and vibrational properties that are tightly correlated. To form h-BN nanodots, h-BN powders are at first dispersed in a solution of concentrated H3PO4 and then thermally treated at 200 °C for 1 h. Then, the dispersion was ultrasonicated for 15 h and the larger h-BN particles removed by centrifugation. In the final step, BN dots were purified by dialysis and filtered. This procedure has allowed obtaining BN dots with very peculiar optical properties. The fluorescence spectra (Figure 5), in fact, show a quite surprising emission in the UV in the as-prepared samples. The emission changes according to the thermal treatment in oxidizing conditions from 25 up to 300 °C. No

UV emission will be detected if the h-BN particles are heated or sonicated. Instead, the UV emission is detectable only after heating and sonication in acid. In pristine BN dots, two distinct emissions are observed: the first one is in the UV range from 300 to 370 nm with excitation at 270 nm, while the second band goes from 370 to 530 nm with excitation and emission maxima at 310 and 420 nm, respectively. Blue emission may also be stimulated by 270 nm irradiation, resulting in a distinctive UV−blue double fluorescence. The blue emission reaches a maximum at 200 °C, in perfect accordance with what is observed in the BN dots obtained via bottom-up
synthesis. The origin of such an emission is therefore attributed to structural defects connected with B−OH species. The UV emission, instead, is more intriguing, and its correlation with a specific defect is not straightforward. The UV photoluminescence, at 260 nm, depends on peculiar structural defects that form in the BN crystal lattice, irrespective of the particular morphology. The infrared absorption spectra demonstrate a specific correlation between fluorescence and structural properties (Figure 6).
The characteristic in-plane B−N stretching at 1372 cm−1 (Figure 6) appears formed by two overlapping components, an
almost temperature-independent mode at 1372 cm−1 and a
second band at 1383 cm−1, which monotonically decrease in intensity with the temperature and disappear at 250 °C. The difference between the infrared spectra of as-made BN and the dots prepared at 250 °C indicates the presence of a sharp band (Figure 6d). This infrared band is correlated to the UV emission at 320 nm; in fact, the thermal treatment promotes a decrease in
both UV fluorescence and the 1383 cm−1 band. This suggests that a direct correspondence exists between the physical properties of the two dots. The splitting of the in-plane B−N stretching infrared band should be correlated to changes of the intrinsic hexagonal crystal structure; therefore, a characteristic defect and the consequent local deformation of the lattice that affects the BN in-plane vibrational features should exist. This defect causes UV fluorescence emission connected with saturating −OH and −H groups. Stone−Wales defects, created by rotating a B−N pair by 90°, might be the source of the UV emission. DFT studies have demonstrated that pentagon− heptagon Stone−Wales (SW) defects with optical transitions at roughly 4 eV can form due to the favorable energy conditions of substantial strain at the grain boundaries (Figure 7). The synthesis and outcome of the Brønsted acid treatment are summarized in Section 5.

5. FROM BN DEFECTS TO BORON OXIDE, STRUCTURAL DEFECTS AT ORIGIN OF PHOSPHORESCENCE
The correlation between defects and photoluminescence properties in BN structures suggests that defects can also play a major role in pure boron oxide materials. A puzzling phenomenon is the room temperature phosphorescence observed in B2O3. Several research groups have observed the rise of such fluorescence, which is explained by the possible presence of defects. Based on experiments performed on boron nitride nanostructures, it was hypothesized that this effect may also be directly related to the formation of structural defects in
boron oxide.51 The investigation of boron oxide phase transitions during heat treatments at increasing temperatures revealed the occurrence of structural modifications when H3BO3 melts and afterward recrystallizes (Figure 8). The blue and green optical centers are compatible with forming structural defects of oxygen vacancies and unsaturated bonds. They are formed during the melting and recrystallization process and reduce their occurrence by treatment at higher temperatures, where the oxide phase is predominant. Boron oxide samples treated between 200 and 400 °C display exceptional phosphorescence in the visible spectrum. Two different phosphorescent emissions occur at around 480 and 528 nm, related to trapped charge carrier recombinations detected by thermoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) (Figure 9). The afterglow is caused by a trapping and detrapping mechanism that slows down the
recombination at active optical centers. A time-dependent density functional analysis of defective BOH molecules and clusters reveals the formation of near UV and blue optical transitions. The experimental findings well support the hypothesis that the thermal processing of boric acid induces defects that become centers of luminescence and recombination channels in the visible spectrum. This explains why boric acid samples treated between 200 and 400 °C show significant phosphorescence in the visible range. Two distinctive phosphorescent emissions are observed at around 480 and 528 nm. These emissions are linked to the recombination of trapped charge carriers as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and thermoluminescence. Trapping and detrapping occur, delaying the recombination at the active optical centers and producing the afterglow. Time-dependent density functional analysis of defective BOH molecules and clusters reveals near UV and blue absorptions. In thermally treated boric acid samples, these defects cause photoluminescence.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
The formation and control of defects in h-BN nanostructures are the basis of great interest in this material. Defects can be obtained as an uncontrolled side effect of the manufacturing process or intentionally introduced. In two-dimensional nanostructures obtained via bottom-up processes, defect control is also much more difficult because exfoliation processes do not allow for precise control of nanostructures in terms of size, layer thickness, and shape. The defects that generate photoluminescence are closely related, as we have described, to the presence of different types of defects that are observed in both

nanosheets and h-BN dots. Understanding the direct defect− property correspondence on the nanoscale is critical in the use of such materials. Combining experimental methods and theoretical calculations is the best solution to this problem. In this Account, we have seen how the presence of defects in nanostructures is strongly influenced by heat treatment. While this property, on one hand, makes it possible to detect defects accurately, it also shows limitations in using such materials due
to limited thermal stability. The defects indeed depend on the process used to obtain boron nitride nanomaterials. An important point to stress is that defects can be not only vacancies or impurities but also structural defects in honeycomb structures, such as that of h-BN, which can make a significant contribution to changing the material functional properties. Much of the research in this area is focused on controlling defects in monolayers, but as we have seen, the emission of

nanosheets and dots is also created by defects. Dangling bonding and vacancies in the presence of oxygen generate these defects. The next step will be to generate these defects in a controlled manner, even considering that the possible applications of such materials as emissive nanostructures do not require spatial control of the defects. The importance of such an approach has been also illustrated by the last example reported in the Account that regards boron oxide. Formation of optically active defects can generate phosphorescence at room temperature, which has been previously attributed to impurities. More investigations are necessary to fully exploit the potential of optically active h-BN nanostructures, but defects are certainly the key.
